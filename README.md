[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/rjlab/GithubPipelines/_apis/build/status/rivms.mosquittobase?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/rjlab/GithubPipelines/_build/latest?definitionId=2&branchName=master)

Dockerfile uses experimental Mosquitto Debian repository to install latest version of Mosquitto. Alternative would be to build from sources as done by the [official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-mosquitto).
